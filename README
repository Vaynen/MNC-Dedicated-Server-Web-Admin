This project is still in beta stage.

The MNC Dedicated Server Web Admin Tool allows you to manage your server through the use of a web browser.

The Server Admin tool is written completely in client-side script (Javascript & HTML).
No hosting is required to use this tool, simply open the index.html file in a browser.

Browsers that have been tested:
 - Google chrome 13
 - Internet Explorer 8
 - Opera 11.5
 - FireFox 6.0

In order to use this tool, the web admin settings will have to be enabled on your Monday Night Combat dedicated server.
Please consult the Uber Entertainment forums for the most recent details on how to enable this feature.

The following excerpt may be outdated:

You can turn on the web admin feature in the HostileAccess.ini file. 
It requires that you set a user name and password and set the enable flag. 

Here's an example:
[HostileGame.MNCWebAdmin]
WebAdminUsername=bozoTheClown
WebAdminPassword=asdf1234
WebAdminPort=8080
bWebAdminEnabled=true
bDebugLog=false

When the game boots it will listen on port 8080 (or whatever you set it to) for simple REST like web requests.
