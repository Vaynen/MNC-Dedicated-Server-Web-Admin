The Web Admin Tool is currently in Beta stage.

This means that any usage is considered "testing" the tool. No guarantees can be made concerning the reliability of the tool, nor can anyone be held accountable for any damage incurred through the usage of this tool.

This package consists of two parts:

 * Admin Tool (JavaScript based webpage)
 * PHP Proxy

The Admin Tool is an HTML page that utilizes ajax to retrieve game data and display it on screen. The page can be hosted on the Internet but can also be opened from a local drive.

The ajax calls are made to a PHP proxy server. In turn, the PHP proxy server makes calls to the game server. A standard PHP proxy server is always online and available but the source for running your own PHP proxy server is included for anyone who would prefer that option.

Browsers that have been tested:
 - Google chrome 13.0
 - Internet Explorer 8.0
 - Opera 11.5
 - FireFox 6.0

In order to use this tool, the web admin settings will have to be enabled on your Monday Night Combat dedicated server.
Please consult the Uber Entertainment forums for the most recent details on how to enable this feature.

The following excerpt may be outdated:

You can turn on the web admin feature in the HostileAccess.ini file. 
It requires that you set a user name and password and set the enable flag. 

Here's an example:
[HostileGame.MNCWebAdmin]
WebAdminUsername=bozoTheClown
WebAdminPassword=asdf1234
WebAdminPort=8080
bWebAdminEnabled=true
bDebugLog=false

When the game boots it will listen on port 8080 (or whatever you set it to) for simple REST like web requests.
